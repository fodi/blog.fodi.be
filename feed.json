Windy Physics is essentially a 2D side-view physics puzzler mainly inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Machine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Incredible Machine</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)\" target=\"null\">Lemmings</a>.</p>\n<p>The first build should include ball spawners, bouncy balls that the player needs to guide to the right place by placing objects that affect their movement, static walls and maybe a few hazards and should be available some time today. Tomorrow tops.</p>\n<p>The latest build can be found on <a href=\"https://fodi.itch.io/windy-physics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Itch</a>.</p>\n<h2>Devlog</h2>\n<p><strong>Update 1</strong>: the first public build is up on Itch; it has basic editor features (tools for moving, rotating, deleting wind generators), walls, ball spawners and balls. More tools and actual level targets are coming soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I've added an exit where balls should be directed and an objective (number of balls required to complete the level). There's also a timer and some visual flair (yeah, I like particle emitters). I should probably add an \"inventory\" next and figure out how to store and load level data (then probably make a basic level editor).</p>",
