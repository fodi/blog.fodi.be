                <p>We finally ventured into rhythm game territory, which has been on the Lasermagnet Games todo list for quite some time.Â </p>
<p>After skipping the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/hej-2024-jan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January</a> edition of the Hungarian "<a href="https://haviegyjatek.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Havi Egy JÃ¡tÃ©k</a>" ("One Game a Month") jam I was delighted to find out that themes for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/hej-2024-februar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February</a> included "on the beat", which served as an excellent excuse to finally make a rhythm game. Tibor came up with the idea to make something like SteamWorld Dig / Spelunky but with a musical twist: swinging the pickaxe in sync with the beat.</p>
<p>We started making the game on the 29th of February (thank frack it was a leap year :) and had a relatively cozy deadline of March 5th to finish. About 70% of the process was also streamed <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fodi_gamedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on my Twitch</a>, but I'm not sure I'll upload the archives this time.</p>
<p><a href="https://lasermagnet.itch.io/music-miner-marty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Miner Marty is available on Itch</a>, it already received a post-jam update (bugfixes and UX improvements only so far), the original <a href="https://lasermagnet.github.io/games/music-miner-marty-jam-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jam version can be found here</a> for reference.</p>
<p>And here's a little gameplay:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr_IzilGUKQ"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gr_IzilGUKQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></a></p>
<p>Naturally we have a bunch of ideas we might try to add later (combos, tougher blocks, touch input support, enemies, falling blocks, et cetera), but no promises of course :)</p>

                <p>Yesterday I did another live stream and made a puzzle game in three hours for Trijam. It's playable, but wonky.</p>
<p>The jam's theme was "only three" and this time the game's concept came pretty quickly during a post-lunch coffee just a couple hours before I started making it. I wanted to create something that looks a bit like Bejeweled et al (colorful shapes in a grid), but plays more like a sudoku or nonogram puzzle. I like those kinds of "deterministic puzzles", but as I've anticipated, coming up with a proper level generation algorithm is not an easy task (for me at least). So until I have a eureka moment and figure out how to generate levels that can be solved without any ambiguity, the game stays in it's current janky state.</p>
<p>If you're willing to give it a go despite this, you can find <a href="https://fodi.itch.io/trijam-256" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rule of Threes on tch</a>. I also uploaded the stream archive to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMfvmv10Vag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> - and yes, it's in Hungarian again. I'm considering doing the next one in English though.</p>

                <div class="post__inner post__entry">
<p>What happened in 2023 and why did I not make 20 game prototypes like I wanted to? A short postmortem.</p>
<p>Around the end of January last year <a href="file:///D:/Dropbox/Projects/Publii/fodis-blog-on-gamedev/preview/a-brief-intermission-and-a-challenge/index.html">I challenged myself</a> to build 20 video game prototypes in 2023. I only managed to build 8 on my own (some of them with <a href="https://itch.io/profile/teebor9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tibor</a>), so one could say I failed to reach my target.</p>
<p>In March I landed my first paid gamedev gig thanks to the guys over at <a href="https://bardtest.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BardTest.gg.</a> They provide tools for members of the esports community with which they can measure and strengthen their skills like hand-eye coordination, multitasking, decision-making under pressure, et cetera. Their users have access to a variety of mini-games (that's where I come in), which feature core mechanics of first-person shooters and MOBAs. After each play session the players are scored and ranked based on how well they did compared to other users and professional players. Last year I finished the development of 14 mini-games for them, out of which 12 are publicly accessible on their platform at the moment. Counting these, I did manage to reach 20 prototypes, although that wasn't exactly my intention when I came up with the challenge back in February.</p>
<p>My intention was to turn a portion of my ever-increasing idea pile into playable prototypes. One of them was to make a turn-based game that runs on a big screen in a public location that any passerby can control using their phones. I cobbled together the proof of concept for the communication "framework", which worked fine. I became so sure I was going to turn it into an actual game that I bought a used TV and rented an office with a big shop window on a semi-busy street. It worked out great as a new workplace (although I was alone most of the time, so my initial productivity boost dwindled in a few months), but the TV was only collecting dust for 6 months, then my contract was up. We even built a <a href="file:///D:/Dropbox/Projects/Publii/fodis-blog-on-gamedev/preview/bouncy-block-buster/index.html">turn-based physics puzzle</a> for a game jam in July with Tibor, which I could've adapted to this framework... but I didn't. Not sure why.</p>
<p>In October I moved offices and started working from a small flat with a friend of mine (Viktor) who's also a software developer now. This setup provided a productivity boost that still lasts today, most days we're both in the office working on our separate projects.Â </p>
<p>At the end of November I tried streaming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fodi_gamedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a> the first time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8LVGw3EEc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made a short video game from scratch in three hours</a> for TriJam, which was fun, and it only took me 7 months to muster the courage (just checked, I bought the mic in April). I no longer feel completely terrified of it, so I'm planning on streaming from time to time.</p>
<p>My new challenge for 2024 is to make at least 12 video game prototypes (not counting paid gigs this time) and at least 12 game development streams / videos, ideally one every month.</p>

                <p>Last Sunday I had my first Twitch stream (in Hungarian), improvising a game for the 3 hour game jam, <a href="https://itch.io/jam/trijam-247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trijam</a>.</p>
<p>I was slightly nervous, but in the end I had a lot of fun and will probably do this sort of thing again. It's not my intention to grow a huge follower base and I currently have zero interest in taking streaming seriously, but I figured it could work as a coping strategy to mitigate some of my ADHD-like symptoms, like postponing fun hobby stuff indefinitely all the time. In the last few months I was checking out <a href="https://itch.io/jams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game jams on Itch</a> almost every weekend, writing little notes and ideas for the ones I found interesting, but I either didn't manage to get started on any of them, or if I did, I lost momentum after a few hours. I'm hoping live streaming could help with that, even if basically no one is watching it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's worth anyone's time, but since it wasn't much additional effort, I put the edited stream up on YouTube. On the off chance you speak Hungarian and would like to check it out, it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8LVGw3EEc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8LVGw3EEc"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ak8LVGw3EEc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></a></p>
<p>The game turned out to be a pretty simple one (no surprise there), partly because I was narrating everything I was doing and because I wanted to stay inside the 3 hour window. You can <a href="https://fodi.itch.io/trijam-247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">play Magic Pandemic on Itch</a> if you want, the back story is on the page, instructions and controls are shown in-game. It supports 4 control schemes: gamepad, keyboard, touch and technically mouse as well, but I do not recommend that. It seems to be running okay on mobile devices too, but the text UI glitches a little on my Android phone.</p>

                <p>We participated in a game jam with Tibor this weekend, made a precision / physics puzzle heavily inspired by BBTAN.</p>
<p>You can play it <a href="https://lasermagnet.itch.io/icojam-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Itch</a> or <a href="https://play.lasermagnet.com/BBB/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on LaserMagnet.com</a> (use the latter if you want to add it to your home screen). We have tons more ideas on how to proceed, hopefully we won't abandon this project anytime soon :)</p>
<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> I made a time-lapse video of the development process and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o56Y4H1mUqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uploaded it to YouTube</a>. Check it out if that's your thing!</p>
<div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o56Y4H1mUqs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>Also, I fixed a couple of bugs, the post-jam version (1.0.9) can be found <a href="https://play.lasermagnet.com/BBB/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

                    About a week ago I've unearthed an old doodle (a simple "free angle" snake) and made the food bounce around.

                <p>About a week ago I've unearthed an old doodle (a simple "free angle" snake) and made the food bounce around.</p>
<p>You control a snake with the keyboard (press A / D) or the touch screen (tap the left / right side) and you have to pick up the food which bounces off the walls and the snake as well. I have a bunch of ideas to try out, but it's already fairly fun, although it's a bit of a performance hog at the moment.</p>
<p>Check out where this project goes (usually nowhere, but who knows), <a href="https://fodi.itch.io/snakeypong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try SnakeyPong on Itch!</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Airmech + Don't Starve: an open world exploration / crafting / survival game where you can switch between ground and air travel at any time</li>
<li>Mahjong with polyominos: match shapes and/or symbols</li>
<li>Unrailed + Pipe Dream with polyominos: place polyomino shaped rails quickly so the train does not derail, can't choose the shape, but can place anywhere in any rotation</li>
<li>Zuma (or something similar) with multiplayer: either PvP or co-op</li>
<li>Snake + Osmos: small snakes are eaten by big ones</li>
<li>Crimsonland, but you can teleport out of a sticky situation (press a button, quickly choose new location within time limit and radius)
<ul>
<li>additional twist: clone player instead of teleporting and control both of them (until one of them dies)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Katamari, but 2D: either side view or top-down, possibly featuring a bunch of googly eyes</li>
</ul>
