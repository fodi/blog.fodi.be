                <p>Yesterday I did another live stream and made a puzzle game in three hours for Trijam. It's playable, but wonky.</p>
<p>The jam's theme was "only three" and this time the game's concept came pretty quickly during a post-lunch coffee just a couple hours before I started making it. I wanted to create something that looks a bit like Bejeweled et al (colorful shapes in a grid), but plays more like a sudoku or nonogram puzzle. I like those kinds of "deterministic puzzles", but as I've anticipated, coming up with a proper level generation algorithm is not an easy task (for me at least). So until I have a eureka moment and figure out how to generate levels that can be solved without any ambiguity, the game stays in it's current janky state.</p>
<p>If you're willing to give it a go despite this, you can find <a href="https://fodi.itch.io/trijam-256" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rule of Threes on tch</a>. I also uploaded the stream archive to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMfvmv10Vag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> - and yes, it's in Hungarian again. I'm considering doing the next one in English though.</p>

                <div class="post__inner post__entry">
<p>What happened in 2023 and why did I not make 20 game prototypes like I wanted to? A short postmortem.</p>
<p>Around the end of January last year <a href="file:///D:/Dropbox/Projects/Publii/fodis-blog-on-gamedev/preview/a-brief-intermission-and-a-challenge/index.html">I challenged myself</a> to build 20 video game prototypes in 2023. I only managed to build 8 on my own (some of them with <a href="https://itch.io/profile/teebor9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tibor</a>), so one could say I failed to reach my target.</p>
<p>In March I landed my first paid gamedev gig thanks to the guys over at <a href="https://bardtest.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BardTest.gg.</a> They provide tools for members of the esports community with which they can measure and strengthen their skills like hand-eye coordination, multitasking, decision-making under pressure, et cetera. Their users have access to a variety of mini-games (that's where I come in), which feature core mechanics of first-person shooters and MOBAs. After each play session the players are scored and ranked based on how well they did compared to other users and professional players. Last year I finished the development of 14 mini-games for them, out of which 12 are publicly accessible on their platform at the moment. Counting these, I did manage to reach 20 prototypes, although that wasn't exactly my intention when I came up with the challenge back in February.</p>
<p>My intention was to turn a portion of my ever-increasing idea pile into playable prototypes. One of them was to make a turn-based game that runs on a big screen in a public location that any passerby can control using their phones. I cobbled together the proof of concept for the communication "framework", which worked fine. I became so sure I was going to turn it into an actual game that I bought a used TV and rented an office with a big shop window on a semi-busy street. It worked out great as a new workplace (although I was alone most of the time, so my initial productivity boost dwindled in a few months), but the TV was only collecting dust for 6 months, then my contract was up. We even built a <a href="file:///D:/Dropbox/Projects/Publii/fodis-blog-on-gamedev/preview/bouncy-block-buster/index.html">turn-based physics puzzle</a> for a game jam in July with Tibor, which I could've adapted to this framework... but I didn't. Not sure why.</p>
<p>In October I moved offices and started working from a small flat with a friend of mine (Viktor) who's also a software developer now. This setup provided a productivity boost that still lasts today, most days we're both in the office working on our separate projects.Â </p>
<p>At the end of November I tried streaming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fodi_gamedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a> the first time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8LVGw3EEc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made a short video game from scratch in three hours</a> for TriJam, which was fun, and it only took me 7 months to muster the courage (just checked, I bought the mic in April). I no longer feel completely terrified of it, so I'm planning on streaming from time to time.</p>
<p>My new challenge for 2024 is to make at least 12 video game prototypes (not counting paid gigs this time) and at least 12 game development streams / videos, ideally one every month.</p>

                <p>Last Sunday I had my first Twitch stream (in Hungarian), improvising a game for the 3 hour game jam, <a href="https://itch.io/jam/trijam-247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trijam</a>.</p>
<p>I was slightly nervous, but in the end I had a lot of fun and will probably do this sort of thing again. It's not my intention to grow a huge follower base and I currently have zero interest in taking streaming seriously, but I figured it could work as a coping strategy to mitigate some of my ADHD-like symptoms, like postponing fun hobby stuff indefinitely all the time. In the last few months I was checking out <a href="https://itch.io/jams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game jams on Itch</a> almost every weekend, writing little notes and ideas for the ones I found interesting, but I either didn't manage to get started on any of them, or if I did, I lost momentum after a few hours. I'm hoping live streaming could help with that, even if basically no one is watching it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's worth anyone's time, but since it wasn't much additional effort, I put the edited stream up on YouTube. On the off chance you speak Hungarian and would like to check it out, it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8LVGw3EEc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8LVGw3EEc"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ak8LVGw3EEc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></a></p>
<p>The game turned out to be a pretty simple one (no surprise there), partly because I was narrating everything I was doing and because I wanted to stay inside the 3 hour window. You can <a href="https://fodi.itch.io/trijam-247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">play Magic Pandemic on Itch</a> if you want, the back story is on the page, instructions and controls are shown in-game. It supports 4 control schemes: gamepad, keyboard, touch and technically mouse as well, but I do not recommend that. It seems to be running okay on mobile devices too, but the text UI glitches a little on my Android phone.</p>
<p>If you feel the need to follow me on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Fodi_be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fodi_gamedev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://fodi.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Itch</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iHG7YRorgM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tich, Mick, Beaky, Dozy or Dave Dee</a>, please feel to do so! :)</p>

                <p>We participated in a game jam with Tibor this weekend, made a precision / physics puzzle heavily inspired by BBTAN.</p>
<p>You can play it <a href="https://lasermagnet.itch.io/icojam-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Itch</a> or <a href="https://play.lasermagnet.com/BBB/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on LaserMagnet.com</a> (use the latter if you want to add it to your home screen). We have tons more ideas on how to proceed, hopefully we won't abandon this project anytime soon :)</p>
<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> I made a time-lapse video of the development process and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o56Y4H1mUqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uploaded it to YouTube</a>. Check it out if that's your thing!</p>

<p>Also, I fixed a couple of bugs, the post-jam version (1.0.9) can be found <a href="https://play.lasermagnet.com/BBB/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

                <p>About a week ago I've unearthed an old doodle (a simple "free angle" snake) and made the food bounce around.</p>
<p>You control a snake with the keyboard (press A / D) or the touch screen (tap the left / right side) and you have to pick up the food which bounces off the walls and the snake as well. I have a bunch of ideas to try out, but it's already fairly fun, although it's a bit of a performance hog at the moment.</p>
<p>Check out where this project goes (usually nowhere, but who knows), <a href="https://fodi.itch.io/snakeypong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try SnakeyPong on Itch!</a></p>

                <p>I participated in the last Ludum Dare jam (#53) and<span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> made something that is not great but at least playable. And it only took me a month to finish writing the postmortem! :)</span></p>
<p>The theme <strong>delivery</strong> was published at 3 AM CEST on Saturday, I encountered it around 7 o'clock, alerted Tibor, finished booting up and biked down to Kollabor, where I usually work. We decided to work remotely, had a quick kickoff call at around 9 about ideas. The first idea was about food delivery from restaurants to homes on a kinda-3D top-down city map using trebuchets. I spent half an hour researching how much work would it take to allow the player to just input a name of a real city (at which point the game would fetch map data via Google Maps / OpenStreetMap) and use it as a base and came to the conclusion that it's out of the question due to the 3-day deadline of the jam.</p>
<p>After some quick scaffolding in Construct 3 and another call I floated the idea of an Overcooked + Kingdom hybrid (2D side-view food preparation frenzy) with a hint of Angry Birds (delivering the finished food to the right home using a big-ass trebuchet/sling), then quickly reduced it down to just the delivery part, but using a sort of drone that the player can actively control to navigate around obstacles like in Flappy Bird. The <a href="https://send.games/u/x5kgn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first build</a> at 10:50 included the basic movement, obstacles and controls (Space to climb), the <a href="https://send.games/u/3kxzd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second build</a> at 11:25 had the basic pick up and delivery stuff (I, J, K keys for the 3 different items). Some more work and a lunch break followed.</p>
<p>I finished the <a href="https://send.games/u/s8vt7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third build</a> at 13:25; in this we experimented with a slightly different control scheme (W/A/D for movement + similar touch controls), allowing the player to turn around at any time. Tibor raised some good points regarding the control scheme and suggested that we add some angle to the drops for realism, so I first got rid of manual turning in the <a href="https://send.games/u/abna7"></a><a href="https://send.games/u/abna7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fourth build</a> at 13:53 and added a special wall type that turns the player around in the <a href="https://send.games/u/yw25i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fifth</a> at 14:06.</p>
<p>Some more ideation followed and I've added item and target spawners and basic respawn logic in <a href="https://send.games/u/q4pvh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build six</a> at 15:09. A couple of minutes later I added numpad controls in <a href="https://send.games/u/fe4ei">build seven</a>, then started to prepare the project for Tibor, so he can start designing levels and alter level rules just by editing some variables. <a href="https://send.games/u/f9sq2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Build eight</a> included a super small test level (which can be skipped by pressing N) and was the last export for that day at 15:46, then I fixed a few bugs and we both went to a friend's house to conclude day one and consume the things we usually consume at such events.</p>
<p>On Sunday it was almost 11 AM when I managed to boot up and sit down in front of my computer, get a todo list going and contact Tibor. I decided to add some juice by adding shadow light / shadow caster and sine movement behaviors to stuff which resulted in <a href="https://send.games/u/beapf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build nine</a> at 11:39, then I added touchscreen UI and automatic respawn in <a href="https://send.games/u/ntuvt"></a><a href="https://send.games/u/ntuvt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build ten</a> at 12:21 and cycled to my parents for lunch.</p>
<p>I was back in front of the screen at around half 3 and got crackin'. A few hours and a couple of meetings later I finished <a href="https://send.games/u/tkc9h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build eleven</a> at 18:47, which included better touch UI, ammo pickups, shooting, and the first enemy type. After some testing, balancing and bug squashing, I've finished the day with <a href="https://send.games/u/siaxf/"></a><a href="https://send.games/u/siaxf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build twelve</a> at 19:40 and a quick call with Tibor about level design.</p>
<p>We picked up around 10 AM on Monday, I've included Tibor's work-in-progress levels in <a href="https://send.games/u/jnrvj"></a><a href="https://send.games/u/jnrvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build thirteen</a> at 10:56. In the afternoon I started replacing the placeholder assets with better looking ones (by <a href="https://little-martian.itch.io/retro-texture-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Martian</a> and <a href="https://zrghr.itch.io/pixel-art-loot-pixelliverse"></a><a href="https://zrghr.itch.io/pixel-art-loot-pixelliverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cassius</a>) and building a tutorial to introduce the mechanics gradually for players. I sent <a href="https://send.games/u/9iccx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build fourteen</a> to Tibor for testing at 18:34, and fixed bugs in <a href="https://send.games/u/q4p8f/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build fifteen</a> half an hour later. Based on his feedback I finished <a href="https://send.games/u/q9ue4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build sixteen</a> at 21:09, then I threw together a flimsy menu screen (yeah, I'll take the usual please!), fixed some more bugs and uploaded the <a href="https://lasermagnet.itch.io/ludum-dare-53-jam-version">final version</a> around midnight. For some reason the HTML5 build didn't work on the <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53/something-something-delivery-something">LDJAM</a> page, so the final resting place of <strong>Something Something Delivery Something</strong> (obviously named a couple of minutes before publishing) is on Itch. I haven't touched it since and based on previous experience I probably won't either.</p>
<p>And the conclusion? It was fun, exhausting, a great learning experience and I'll remember those three days fondly. And I'm looking forward to the next game jam I'll be able to participate in.</p>

                <p>After some playtesting, movement tweaking and expanding the test level, I decided to add TowerBall to the 2023 prototypes list.</p>
<p>The latest version is <a href="https://play.lasermagnet.com/TowerBall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available here</a>, it's optimized for touchscreen devices and portrait orientation, but it's playable with a mouse and a landscape viewport as well. Feel free "install" or "add it to home screen" on your phone (eg. with Google Chrome), it works offline and also lets you know if a new build is available. You just have to restart it to update to the latest version, there's no need to "reinstall it" .</p>
<p>I'm going to keep playtesting it and ask a few friends to do the same. Once movement and the controls feel right, I'm going to finish the level editor so Tibor (or anyone) can get started with level design and I can add more stuff. Well, that's the plan anyway :)</p>
